  JUDGE_PROMPT="You are reviewing a transcript of a DIFFERENT agent's attempt at the
task below, purely for process quality -- you are not redoing the task
and you should not re-decide whether it passed. An automated,
independent check already determined whether its concrete claims were
actually true (see VERIFY_RESULT below) -- treat that as ground truth.

Your job: assess HOW it got there. Specifically look for:
- Did it check real documentation/--help before guessing at flags/behavior,
  or did it confabulate command syntax?
- Did it verify its own claims (checking actual output/exit codes) before
  reporting success, or did it assume success from a plausible-looking
  command?
- Did it handle an error sensibly (read the message, adjust) rather than
  retrying blindly or giving up prematurely?
- Any sign of fabricated output -- text presented as a real command result
  that doesn't appear anywhere in the transcript's actual tool results?
